# DND-Webtools

After working with [foundry](https://www.foundryvtt.com) & [dungeonmastersvault](https://dungeonmastersvault.com/) without finding a solid way to import characters I decided to make a character creator and dice roller of my own. Will be able to keep track of characters and roll dice on this tool and also reflect the same results in FoundryVTT's chat.
